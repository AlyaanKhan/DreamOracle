🚀Exciting Project Update: DreamOracle Textgram!🚀

I'm thrilled to share a sneak peek of my latest project: DreamOracle Textgram, a web application that leverages Artificial Intelligence and the StackGAN model to bring your texts to life through images. Developed with a robust frontend in React.js and a backend powered by Flask Python, this project showcases some exciting functionalities.

🌟Core Functionalities:
